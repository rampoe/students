        >LEAF was created to provide policymakers with reguler <br />
        scientific assessments on climate, its <br />
        implications and potential future risks, as well as to put <br />
        forward adaptation and mitigation options.</b
      >
      <p>
        Through its assessments, the LEAF determines the state of <br />
        knowledge on climate change. It identifes where there is <br />
        agreement in the scientific community on topics related to <br />
        climate change, and where futher research is needed. The <br />
        reports are drafted and reviewed in several stages, thus <br />
        guaranleeing objectivity and transparency. The LEAF does <br />
        not conduct its own research.
        <br />
        <br />
        LEAF reports are neutral, policy-relevant bul not policy- <br />
        prescriptive. The assessment reports are a key input into the <br />
        international negotiations to tackle climate change.
